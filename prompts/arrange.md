**Objective:** Transform a raw Hebrew math lecture transcript into a readable, verbatim English transcription presented directly within this chat interface.

**Input:** A single block of text representing a raw, unedited Hebrew math lecture transcript.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Translate & Transcribe Verbatim:**
    * Translate the Hebrew text to English with **extreme fidelity**. Your primary goal is a literal, word-for-word transcription of the *spoken* content as captured in the transcript.
    * Retain **all** original verbal elements, including:
        * Filler words (e.g., 'uh', 'um', 'like', equivalent Hebrew fillers).
        * Repetitions and false starts.
        * Self-corrections made by the speaker.
        * Administrative remarks, side comments, or off-topic moments present in the transcript.
    * **Crucially: Do NOT omit, rephrase, paraphrase, summarize, interpret, or add any content, explanations, or annotations.** The output must mirror the original spoken flow and content precisely, simply rendered in English.

2.  **Apply Minimal Formatting Only:**
    * **Punctuation:** Insert standard English punctuation (periods, commas, question marks) where grammatically appropriate based *only* on the translated sentence structure to enhance basic readability.
    * **Paragraphs:** Introduce paragraph breaks *only* to reflect clear, significant shifts in the main topic of discussion or extended pauses demonstrably indicating a transition. Avoid creating new paragraphs for minor hesitations, short pauses, or single sentences unless they represent a distinct topical shift. The goal is logical grouping by content flow, not mimicking exact speech rhythm. **Do not add any thematic headings, subheadings, or section titles.**
    * **Numerals:** Convert any spoken number words (e.g., "shnayim", "three and a half") into their standard digit form (e.g., "2", "3.5") in the English translation.

3.  **Render Mathematical Notation:**
    * Identify **all** mathematical expressions, symbols, variables, formulas, and equations within the text.
    * Render these using **beautifully displayed LaTeX** (as per user preference, e.g., $\frac{a}{b}$, $\sum_{k=0}^N f(k)$, $\mathbb{R}^n$). Ensure both inline math (within sentences) and display math (standalone equations) are correctly formatted and rendered. Use standard LaTeX conventions.

**Output:**
* Deliver the final output as **plain text directly within this chat interface.**
* The output must consist *only* of the minimally formatted, verbatim English translation, including all original speech patterns and rendered mathematics.
* Ensure **no** summaries, introductory/concluding remarks, LLM commentary, or structural elements (beyond basic punctuation and essential paragraph breaks as defined above) are added to the translated text.
